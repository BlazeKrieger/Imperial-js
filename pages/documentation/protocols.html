      <h3>Gel Extraction Protocol</h3>
      <p>MATERIALS AND APPARATUS:<br><br>
        •	Isopropanol (100%)<br>
        •	Water bath at 50°C<br>
        •	Buffer PE with 96-100% ethanol (see bottle label for volume)<br>
        •	Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm<br>
        •	Scalpel<br>
        •	Buffer QG<br><br>
        PROCEDURE:<br><br>
        Steps:<br><br>
        1.	Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.<br><br>
        2.	Weigh the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes Buffer QG to 1 volume gel 
        (100 mg gel ~100 μl). <br><br>
        NOTE: The maximum amount of gel per spin column is 400 mg. For >2% agarose gels, add 6 volumes Buffer QG.<br><br>
        3.	Incubate at 50°C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). Vortex the 
        tube every 2–3 min to help dissolve gel. After the gel slice has dissolved completely, 
        check that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved 
        agarose). <br><br>
        NOTE: If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 μl 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix. The mixture turns yellow.<br><br>
        4.	Add 1 gel volume isopropanol to the sample and mix.<br><br>
        5.	Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 ml collection tube. Apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube. <br><br>
        NOTE: For sample volumes >800 μl, load and spin/apply vacuum again.<br><br>
        6.	If DNA will subsequently be used for sequencing / in vitro transcription / microinjection, 
        add 500 μl Buffer QG to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube.<br><br>
        7.	To wash, add 750 μl Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube.<br><br>
        NOTE: If the DNA will be used for salt-sensitive applications (e.g., sequencing, bluntended ligation), let the column stand 2–5 min after addition of Buffer PE. Centrifuge the QIAquick column in the provided 2 ml collection tube for 1 min to remove residual wash buffer.<br><br>
        8.	Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.<br><br>
        9.	To elute DNA, add 50 μl Buffer EB to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min. Add 30 μl Buffer EB to the center of the QIAquick membrane again, let the column stand for up to 4 min, and then centrifuge for 1 min. <br><br>
        NOTE: If purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel.<br><br>

      <h3>Setting LB PLates Protocol</h3>
      <p>MATERIALS AND APPARATUS:<br><br>
        •	2.5g yeast extract<br>
        •	5g peptone <br>
        •	5g NaCl<br>
        •	7.5g agar-agar<br>
        •	1L sterile bottle (check to see if this fits in the microwave for reheating)<br>
        •	Sterile dH2O<br>
        •	Sterile Petri dishes (Hackspace should have ~100mm diameter, holds ~20mL agar, should be able to see 100-200 colonies)<br>
        •	Ice bucket for keeping antibiotic on<br>
        •	Chloroamphenicol antibiotic stored at 1000X concentration, dissolved in EtOH	<br>
            o	Recommended stock conc = 25mg/mL, working concentration = 25ug/mL<br><br>
        PROCEDURE:<br><br>
        Per 500mL molten LB agar: (25 plates)<br><br>
        NOTE: This makes 25 plates, but we only need 16 plates total for Stage 1. <br><br>
        1.	Weigh out the following into a 1L sterile bottle (20g total, pre-mixed powder in Hackspace contains first three components, then add 7.5g agar-agar separately):<br>
        •	2.5g yeast extract<br>
        •	5g peptone <br>
        •	5g NaCl<br>
        •	7.5g agar-agar<br>
        2.	Make up solution to 500mL using sterile dH2O, gently swirl to mix and minimise amount of powder left on sides of bottle.<br><br>
        3.	Screw lid on bottle loosely and label with autoclave tape.<br><br>
        4.	Autoclave at 121C for 20 minutes<br><br>
        5.	Remove solution from autoclave and cool to 50C (just about hot to touch but not too hot).<br><br>
        NOTE: Don’t need to use water bath for cooling to specific temperature unless generating a lot of plates & need to stop the agar from solidifying.<br><br>
        6.	If making LB-Chlor plates, add 500uL of 25mg/mL antibiotic to solution and swirl to mix.<br><br>
        7.	Pour 20mL of molten LB agar per 10cm diameter Petri dish. This should be conducted aseptically in a fume hood. Use 25mL pipette with Pipetboy to measure exact volumes. <br><br>
        NOTE: Do not eject volume from pipette too quickly, or bubbles will be introduced. Bubbles can be removed using a small pipette tip. When pouring, remove lid to dish and remove lid to bottle, then pour as specified above. Work quickly, as the agar will harden very quickly so pouring should be done in 5 minutes.<br><br>
        8.	Place the lids on the plates and allow them to cool for 45 minutes or until solidified, then invert plates. To avoid condensation on the plates, stack 4-5 plates together, then stack the stacks so that the only plates that will accumulate condensation on the lid are the ones at the top of the stack. Store sealed with Parafilm at 4C. <br><br>
        NOTE: Dried plates should be taped shut and stacked upside down on their lids in a container to protect from light. Write the date of preparation on the plates, make sure plates are not more than 2 months old.<br><br>

        PROCEDURE: <br><br>
        NOTE: All steps should be carried out aseptically in the fume hood, unless otherwise stated, keep all reagents on ice, time ~ 55 min total.<br><br>
        Day 1:<br><br>
        1.	Streak out stock of previously-competent TOP10 cells onto an LB plate with no antibiotics to obtain single colonies (if LB plate needs to be made, see this protocol for setting plates). Cover with lid and incubate overnight at 37C. <br><br>
        2.	Autoclave:<br> 
        2.1.	500mL SOB medium (not going to use it all)<br>
        2.2.	10% glycerol <br>
        2.3.	Microcentrifuge tubes<br>
        2.4.	50mL Falcons (for centrifuging)<br><br>
        Day 2:<br><br>
        1.	Pre-warm: Pre-warm 50mL SOB medium at 37C in a water bath at the start of day 2. <br><br>
        2.	Reserve control: Keep 10mL SOB medium WITHOUT bacteria in a small bottle or Falcon to act as blank sample when measuring OD600 on Day 3. <br><br>
        3.	Starter culture: At end of day, prepare 50mL sterile Falcon containing 10mL SOB medium. Using a sterile toothpick or pipette tip, pick up a single colony of cells from incubated Day 1 plate, then drop into Falcon. Cover flask with foil and incubate this starter culture overnight at 37C in a rotary shaker set to 225rpm. Prewarm the SOB medium in the same incubator, to be used the following day. <br><br>
        NOTE: To grow, bacteria flasks should never be filled with more than a quarter of its max volume, otherwise the aeration will be limiting. <br><br>
        To prep for Day 3:<br><br>
        Chill the following in 4C fridge: <br>
        •	Centrifuge rotor (ask Hackspace)<br>
        •	1L 10% glycerol<br><br>
        Day 3:<br><br>
        1.	In a flask, inoculate 2.5mL of the starter culture in 250mL fresh SOB medium (the volumes of starter culture and SOB should always be at a 1:100 ratio). <br><br>
        2.	Incubate at 37C in a rotary shaker set to 225rpm until the OD600 is between 0.4-0.6 (0.4 most common).<br><br>
        NOTE: Optimal transformation efficiencies are achieved when E. coli cells are at an optical density, OD600nm ~0.4-0.5. DO NOT LET IT GO ABOVE 0.5. To obtain this biomass, the cell suspension should be checked every 30 minutes using a spectrophotometer. It usually takes between 2-3 hours after inoculation of the culture to reach this point. There is a 10 minute window to transfer the flask to ice (see next step).<br><br>
        3.	Once target OD600 is hit, transfer flask to ice, then transfer all contents of the flask to a 4x fresh 50mL Falcon tubes and keep on ice for 5-10 min. Swirl occasionally to ensure that cooling occurs evenly. <br><br>
        NOTE: After this point, do not let cells warm up past 4C. When pouring off supernatant, be careful not to disturb the pellet. If the pellet seems loose, re-spin the cells down. Aspirate with a pipette if necessary. <br><br>
        4.	Centrifuge 1: Pellet the cells by centrifuging at 4000rpm for 5 minutes at 4C. <br><br>
        5.	Pour off supernatant. Aspirate any residual broth. Resuspend each Falcon tube pellet in 10mL ice-cold sterile distilled water, then add another 40mL (so total = 50mL water added per Falcon). <br><br>
        6.	Centrifuge 2: Pellet the cells again by centrifuging at 4000rpm for 5 minutes at 4C.<br><br>
        7.	Resuspend in 2x 50mL distilled water (start with 4 tubes, resuspend each pellet in 10mL water, then transfer the contents of Tube 1 to Tube 2 and the contents of Tube 3 to Tube 4, then add 30mL distilled water to each of the remaining 2 tubes). <br><br>
        NOTE: At the end of this process, you should have 2 empty Falcons, and 2 full Falcons. <br><br>
        8.	Centrifuge 3: Pellet the cells again by centrifuging at 4000rpm for 5 minutes at 4C.<br><br>
        9.	Resuspend in 2x 50mL 10% glycerol. <br><br>
        10.	Centrifuge 4: Pellet the cells again by centrifuging at 4000rpm for 7 minutes at 4C. <br><br>
        11.	Pour away supernatant slowly, then resuspend the cells in a final volume of 200uL of ice-cold 10% glycerol.<br><br>
        NOTE: At this stage, you should have a total volume of 400uL cell suspension, divided into 2x 200uL in Falcons. At this stage, either move onto electroporation protocol or store away. <br><br>
        12.	Snap-freeze: Pre-cool 10x 1.5mL eppys on dry ice, keep lids open. Aliquot 40uL cells into each tube, work quickly. Store in –80C freezer.<br><br>

        o	Quantity: Each sample to be electroporated needs one fresh 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube and one 0.1cm cuvette. <br>
        •	Hackspace-provided Eppendorf 5810R Centrifuge<br>
        •	LB-Chlor liquid broth<br>

        •	SOC recovery medium<br><br>
        
        LB broth/agar:<br><br>
        Per 500mL LB agar: (25 plates)<br><br>
        •	2.5g yeast extract<br>
        •	5g peptone <br>
        •	5g NaCl<br>
        •	7.5g agar-agar<br>

        •	Ice bucket for keeping antibiotic on<br>
        •	Chloroamphenicol antibiotic stored at 1000X concentration, dissolved in EtOH	<br>
        o	Recommended stock conc = 25mg/mL, working concentration = 25ug/mL<br><br>
        Procedure:  per 500mL molten LB agar = 25 plates<br><br>
        NOTE: This makes 25 plates, but we only need 16 plates total for Stage 1. <br><br>
        1.	Weigh out the following into a 1L sterile bottle (20g total, pre-mixed powder in Hackspace contains first three components):<br>
        •	2.5g yeast extract<br>
        •	5g peptone <br>
        •	5g NaCl<br><br>
        If making LB agar plates, add:<br>
        •	7.5g agar-agar<br><br>
        2.	Make up solution to 500mL using sterile dH2O, gently swirl to mix and minimise amount of powder left on sides of bottle.<br><br>
        3.	Screw lid on bottle loosely and label with autoclave tape<br><br>
        4.	Autoclave at 121C for 20 minutes<br><br>
        5.	Remove solution from autoclave and cool to <50C (just about hot to touch but not too hot).<br><br>
        NOTE: Don’t need to use water bath for cooling to specific temperature unless generating a lot of plates & need to stop the agar from solidifying.<br><br>
        6.	If making LB-Chlor plates, cool the LB medium down further until near room temperature and add 500uL of antibiotic to solution and swirl to mix.<br><br>
         
        SOC (Super Optimised Broth with Catabolite Repression)<br><br>
        Per litre of SOB:<br><br>
        NOTE: If available in dry premixed form in the Hackspace, check ratios of each component. <br><br>
        •	2% (w/v) tryptone/peptone<br>
        •	0.5% (w/v) yeast extract<br>
        •	10 mM NaCl<br>
        •	2.5 mM KCl<br>
        •	20 mM MgSO4<br><br>
        1.	Dissolve the following in 500mL of distilled water (ddH2O): <br>
        •	10g tryptone/peptone <br>
        •	5g yeast extract <br>
        •	0.292g NaCl<br>
        •	0.093g KCl<br>
        •	1.2g MgSO4 <br><br>
        2.	 Bring final volume to 500mL with more distilled water (ddH2O)<br><br>
        Adjust to pH 7.5 before use, requires approx. 25mL of 1M NaOH solution per litre of SOB made (so instead of using 200mL water to bring final volume to 1L, use 175mL water + 25mL 1M NaOH.)<br><br>
        3.	Cool SOB medium to <50C, then add 10ml syringe filter-sterilised 20% (w/v) glucose solution<br><br>
        NOTE: To filter-sterilise the glucose solution, attach a single-use, sterile 0.2um pore filter to a syringe tip, and screw down the syringe to secure it. Position the syringe at the mouth of a sterile Falcon tube, then pour the glucose solution into the syringe and gently push down the plunger. <br><br>
        
        Preparation steps for previous day:<br>
        •	Pre-warm 2mL SOC recovery medium and LB-Chlor agar plates in 37C incubator (no shaking necessary) for at least 1 hour. <br>
        •	Make 50% glycerol<br><br>
        NOTE: For each 40uL aliquot of electrocompetent cells, use 2mL SOC. Use this ratio to scale up for each transformation reaction you want to do. # cells in aliquot doesn’t matter, colonies will be grown out of them anyway. <br><br>
        •	Pre-chill in 4C freezer: plasmid DNA, electroporation cuvettes, microcentrifuge tubes, distilled water, and 10% glycerol. <br><br>
        
        PROCEDURE:<br><br>
        1.	Thaw the 40uL aliquots of electrocompetent cells on ice. Add 2 µL of purified DNA from Miniprep. <br><br>
        2.	Mix by gently flicking the tube containing the electrocompetent cell + DNA mixture. Do not handle cells vigorously as this will reduce transformation efficiency. Let the mixture sit on ice for 1 minute.<br><br>
        3.	Pipette the mixture into a chilled 0.1 cm electroporation cuvette, gently tap the cuvette on a flat surface to ensure the mixture is at the bottom of the cuvette.<br><br>
        4.	Wipe any condensation off the sides of the cuvette before placing the cuvette in the chamber slide.<br><br>
        5.	Push the slide into the chamber until the cuvette is seated between the contacts in the base of the chamber. Ensure the pulser is set to “Ec1” and press the "Pulse" button once.<br><br>
        6.	Remove the cuvette from the chamber and immediately add 1mL of pre-warmed SOC recovery medium to the cuvette. Quickly and gently resuspend cells with a pipette. <br><br>
        NOTE: you need to be quick about transferring the cells to SOC medium; delaying the transfer between the stage at which you apply the pulse to the stage where SOC medium is added is crucial for recovering transformants. Delaying by a single minute causes a 3-fold drop in transformation. <br><br>
        7.	Transfer the mixture to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.<br><br>
        8.	Incubate for 60 minutes at 37°C in a shaking incubator at 225rpm – ensure the tube lays flat.<br><br>
        9.	Prepare two plates:<br>
        a.	Streak plate 50uL of the cell mixture on a LB-Chlor plate. Incubate overnight at 37C. <br>
        b.	Spin the remainder of cells at 3000 rpm for 2 minutes. Remove all but 50 μL media (otherwise you will lose pellet). Streak plate with remaining cells on a LB-Chlor plate. Incubate overnight at 37°C.<br><br>
        Making glycerol stocks of transformed cells: <br><br>
        1.	Prepare autoclaved liquid LB-Chlor medium. Reserve 10mL of LB-Chlor for blank when measuring OD600.<br><br>
        2.	Making an overnight culture: pick a colony of transformed cells from the LB-Chlor plate and add to 5mL LB-Chlor in 50mL Falcon (for mini-prep of plasmid). Incubate the tube overnight at 37C at 225rpm.<br><br>
        3.	Next morning, take 2 ml for miniprep, use remaining for glycerol stock.<br><br>
        4.	Add 1 mL of the overnight culture to an equal amount of 50% filtered glycerol in a 2 mL screw top tube or Eppys and gently mix by pipetting 5-6 times. <br><br>
        Note: Adding the 50% glycerol to an equal volume of cells effectively dilutes it down to 25%<br><br>
        5.	Freeze the glycerol stock tube at -80°C. Subsequent freeze and thaw cycles reduce shelf life.<br><br>
        6.	To recover bacteria from your glycerol stock, open the tube and use a sterile loop, toothpick or pipette tip to scrape some of the frozen bacteria off the top. Do not let the glycerol stock unthaw. Keep on ice block.<br><br>
        7.	Grow bacteria overnight at 37C, for plasmid miniprep the following day. <br><br>
